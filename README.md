 # Web Malware Scanner


    A collection of Bash scripts created for this project are intended to search websites for harmful links that could lead to trojans, spyware, or malware. The scanner enables for the update of the database with the most recent CVE information and compares the content of websites to a local database of known dangerous URLs.



# Task Organization

    *fetch_website_content.sh: Retrieves a URL's content.
    
    *parse_and_scan.sh: This script parses HTML text, pulls out URLs, and verifies them against signatures.JSON data set.
    
    *update_signatures.sh: This script adds the most recent CVE information to the local database of dangerous URLs.
    
    *recognized signatures for trojans, spyware, and malware are kept in the signatures.json file.
    
    *The main script, scan.sh, updates the signatures, asks the user for a URL, and scans the website.
    
    *The user can manually add a new signature to the signatures using the add_signature.sh script.JSON data set.



#Scanning a Website

    Run scan.sh to update the signatures and scan a website for malicious links.

# Installation 

   *sudo chmod +x scan.sh

   *sudo ./scan.sh


      When prompted, provide the website's URL (name, domain, or IP address).
      The script will check the content of the website for harmful links and update the signatures with the most recent CVE data.


# Notes

     Ensure that all scripts are located in the same directory and are executable.
     The signatures.json file should be updated regularly to maintain an up-to-date database of malicious links.
     This project requires curl and jq to be installed on your system.
     The CVE data is fetched from https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems.csv, which is updated regularly to include the latest vulnerabilities.
